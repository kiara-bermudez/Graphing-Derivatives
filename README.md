# Graphing-Derivatives

 This project allows you to input 4 coefficients to use in a function f(x) of format Ax^3  + Bx^2 + Cx + D. It then takes thefirst and second order derivatives of the function and then outputs a graph of f(x), f'(x) and f"(x). 
 
 Concepts:
 - Functions
 - Arithmetic operations
 - Numpy
